Kodify is a multi-language code beautifier for HTML pages
---------------------------------------------------------

Unlike most other code beautifiers which run on the server
side, Kodify runs in the browser, allowing you to use
more semantic markup (i.e. it doesn't fill your page with
<span> tags or CSS.

What makes Kodify undisputably more powerful & flexible
than other code beautifiers is the fact that it is powered
by a real lexical analyzer based on the long-proven C tool
lex.

Styling is done by manipulating the DOM to add class name
attributes to tokens detected in the text of elements
given the "kodify" class name.

Kodify supports multiple themes as lightweight, basic CSS
files.

Adding new languages to Kodify is easy and simply requires
an understanding of JavaScript (ECMAScript actually) and
some knowledge of state-based lexical analysis.  See the
Lx project for more information on the scanning routine.

The provided language specifications in the "js/lang"
directory should serve as a good starting point.

USAGE:
------

Refer to the file "demo/index.html" for an example.

You need to include a few .js files in your web page:

<script type="text/javascript" src="kodify/js/lx_analyzer.js">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="kodify/js/kodify.js">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="kodify/js/lang/lang-name.js">
</script>

The last <script> tag above includes the relevant language file.
You should replace "lang-name.js" with the relevant language
file (e.g. "php.js").

You also need to include a theme of your choice:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
  href="kodify/themes/dark.css" />

All code blocks to be colorized must have the class name "kodify"
in addition to the language they contain.  If they do not contain
any specific language the generic ruleset will be used instead.

<code><pre class="kodify js">
function AJavaScriptFunction(foo) {
  //Code etc etc
}
</pre></code>

Kodify will automatically apply styles to your code sections when
the page has completed loading.
